## Project objective
Without JavaScript, this page displays a long list of students. I have enhanced the usability of the page by using unobtrusive JavaScript to dynamically divide the list into "pages". Each 'page' now only displays 10 students at a time.

## Features
In addition to completing the basic requirements for this techdegree project, I also built additional features and functionality using JavaScript such as:

- [x] Added a search feature to filter/find students
- [x]
- [x]

## Code example
An example of one of the JavaScript functions in this project:
