# List Pagination and Filtering

The project can be viewed by visiting https://nickhericks.github.io/techdegree-project-2/

Without JavaScript, this page displays a long list of students. When JavaScript is added we can break the page up into separate pages that only display 10 students at a time. Users can also use the search bar to search for individual students by name.

### Techniques and concepts used:
- Pagination - Use JavaScript to change long list into multiple pages.
- Progressive enhancement - JavaScripthas been added to improve the user experience without making the page dependent upon JavaScript.
- Filtering - Used for search functionality.



_This project was created as part of Treehouse's Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree._
